# Julius Lukas - Computer Science ePortfolio

**Julius Lukas – B.S. Computer Science with Software Engineering Candidate**

This portfolio highlights how far I’ve come in software development, database design, and algorithm implementation. It includes some of the best work I’ve done in the program, with an emphasis on functionality and applicability to my current professional field of pharmacy.

I focused heavily on testing and efficiency. In CS 320, I wrote unit tests with full coverage that handled both expected and edge case scenarios. My database work in DAD 220 used SQL and MongoDB Compass to write queries and other aggregations to display my proficiency in isolating and manipulating real-world data.

On the algorithm side, I used Q-learning to train an agent to navigate a maze, improving the state-action logic and overall learning performance. It taught me a lot about applying AI concepts in practical ways, with a fun twist that may eventually be applied in future hospitals.

Along the way, I’ve worked in team settings, written documentation that makes sense to others, and built with security in mind from the start. Everything here reflects skills I’ve sharpened and can apply immediately in the workplace, along with a creative mindset ready to adapt to any unique challenges ahead.
