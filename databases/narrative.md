# Databases Narrative

### Description:
This project came from my work in DAD 220 and involved setting up a MongoDB database using Compass. The database was made up of three collections: drugs, patients, and prescriptions. I started with CSV files and imported them into MongoDB Compass, connecting them through a shared value like patient ID or prescription ID. 

### Justification for Inclusion:
I chose this because it shows my ability to work with NoSQL databases and build a working system using real-world healthcare data. I changed the original context to be more healthcare-focused by using drug names, patient demographics, and prescription records. I also implemented role-based access control (RBAC) and queried the data to be visually appealing using MongoDB Compass.

### Reflections and Learning:
This enhancement went smoothly, and I learned how much easier Compass makes things like imports, filtering, and aggregation compared to raw command-line SQL. At the same time, I noticed that Compass started slowing down with only 500 records, so I would probably go back to using raw queries if I were working with larger datasets or needed more performance. This project helped me understand the structure of NoSQL data and made me more comfortable switching between SQL and MongoDB when needed.
