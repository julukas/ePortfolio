# Algorithms & Data Structures Narrative

**Artifact:** Treasure Maze Q-Learning Project  
**Date:** April 2025

### Description:
This project uses Q-learning to teach an agent how to move through a maze. The agent learns which direction to go based on rewards and punishments it gets from each move. Over time, it figures out the fastest way to reach the goal.

### Justification for Inclusion:
I included this because it shows my understanding of how algorithms work in action. I improved the way the state and rewards were handled to make the training more reliable. It also shows my ability to build a working system that uses logic and reinforcement to solve a problem.

### Reflections and Learning:
What made this challenging was getting the agent to actually learn instead of wandering aimlessly. I had to fine-tune how rewards were given and how the state was set up, which taught me how sensitive these systems are. After making adjustments, the agent got faster and more consistent at solving the maze.
