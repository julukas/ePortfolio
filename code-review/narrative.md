# Code Review Video Narrative

In these videos, I walk through the three main artifacts included in my ePortfolio: Software Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases. In the comments below Iâ€™ll cover what each artifact does, the enhancements I made, and how those changes align with the CS 499 course outcomes.

## Software Engineering

The software engineering artifact started as a set of unit tests written in Java. I converted the project to Python, added more realistic healthcare context, and created a method to return appointment details as JSON for potential API use. This shows my ability to write and test clean code, and to adapt it for real-world scenarios.

## Algorithms and Data Structures

The algorithms artifact is a maze-solving project that uses Q-learning, a reinforcement learning algorithm. I improved the reward system, optimized the way the agent learns over time, and made the results more consistent. This project demonstrates my understanding of how to apply algorithmic concepts to solve real problems.

## Databases

The database project was originally built with SQL but was enhanced using MongoDB Compass. I loaded patient, prescription, and drug data into MongoDB and used aggregation pipelines to perform queries. I also implemented role-based access control to restrict access based on user type. These updates show my ability to work with both relational and NoSQL databases.

Each of these artifacts represents a different area of computer science, and the improvements I made demonstrate my growth and technical skills throughout the program.
