# Software Engineering Narrative

**Artifact:** Appointment and AppointmentTest Files  
**Course:** CS 320 - Software Testing and Automation  
**Date:** April 2025  

### Artifact Description:
I chose the Appointment and AppointmentTest files from my CS 320 course. The original purpose of these files was to demonstrate effective unit testing. I enhanced this artifact by converting it from Java to Python and made it specifically applicable to healthcare scenarios.

### Justification for Inclusion:
This artifact highlights important software engineering skills I've developed:
- **Unit Testing:** Unit testing is widely used in professional software development, and this artifact clearly demonstrates my ability to create comprehensive unit tests.
- **Healthcare Focus:** By adapting it to function as a healthcare appointment scheduler, I also adjusted the artifact to have a practical, real-world use.
- **Language Conversion:** Converting the project from Java to Python showcases my technical skills and my stronger proficiency in Python.

Additionally, I improved this artifact by adding functionality to return appointment details in JSON format, facilitating integration with APIs.

### Reflections and Learning:
Creating the initial Java version required more effort because it involved significant planning. Converting it into Python was relatively easier due to my stronger Python skills. However, challenges arose when I chose which Python functions best matched the Java version, especially for date comparisons. I ultimately chose `isinstance()` and `timedelta`. Ensuring that the Python unit tests covered similar scenarios to the Java tests also required careful verification. If I expanded this project further, I would focus on enhancing input validation and securing the API interactions.
